# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-ANN
Project Description:
The project aims to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to enhance the security of computer networks. The IDS will be designed to detect and respond to potential intrusions and malicious activities in real-time, providing an intelligent defense mechanism against cyber threats.

The project will involve the following key components and functionalities:

Data Collection: A comprehensive dataset of network traffic patterns, including both normal and malicious activities, will be collected. This dataset will serve as the foundation for training the ANN.

Preprocessing: The collected network traffic data will undergo preprocessing steps, such as feature extraction and normalization, to ensure optimal input for the ANN.

Artificial Neural Network Design: An ANN architecture suitable for intrusion detection will be designed. The architecture may include multiple layers, such as input, hidden, and output layers, with appropriate activation functions and connectivity patterns.

Training Phase: The ANN will be trained using the preprocessed dataset. This training process involves adjusting the weights and biases of the neural network to minimize the error between the predicted and actual network traffic labels.

Testing and Evaluation: The trained ANN will be evaluated using a separate dataset of network traffic. The performance of the IDS will be assessed based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Real-time Detection: The developed IDS will be deployed in a real-time network environment to monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic. The ANN will analyze the traffic patterns and classify them as either normal or suspicious.

Alert Generation and Response: When the IDS detects a potential intrusion or suspicious activity, it will generate alerts or trigger appropriate response mechanisms. This may include notifying network administrators, blocking the suspicious connection, or initiating additional security protocols.

Continuous Learning and Improvement: The IDS will be designed to adapt and improve its detection capabilities over time. Feedback from security analysts and new data will be incorporated to update and refine the ANN model, ensuring it stays effective against emerging threats.

The project will require the utilization of programming languages and frameworks such as Python, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for ANN implementation. Additionally, access to network traffic data or simulation tools will be essential for training and testing the IDS.

By successfully implementing this project, an advanced IDS using ANN will be developed, contributing to the enhanced security of computer networks by efficiently detecting and responding to potential intrusions and malicious activities.
